 ## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is a system that tracks changes in computer files, utalized by git commands.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? git are git commands. git hub is a cloud to hold our code
3. Why do we create a branch? we create a branch so that multiple developers may change, edit or  maniplate a piece of the code without causing any changes to the main code.  
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? A pull request is used to review code changes and mergining the final code into the main code. It allows multiple developers to participate in managing the code. 
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? Git fetch is used to retrieve the changes made to the remote repository without merging them into your current branch. Git merge is utilized to intergrate the changes from one branch into the current branch, while git pull acts as an all around command combining the functionality of git fetch and git merge doing both objectives at once, Fetching the latest changes to a branch and merging them into your current branch. 
7. What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is when multiple changes to the same line of code is being submitted are different, causing a conflict that GIT is unable to resolve on its own.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? You must edit the affected files manually and then commit the changes to the codebase, to resolve a merge conflict.
